            <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
            <p>Through my time through education I have had time to explore my intrests in programming. In year 10 I started a young enterprise business as Managing Directior where my team and I set off to create a mobile game. This helped spark my passion in software development as we developed the game. This was the begining of my experiance with C#. The game was published to the Google Play Store under the name of 'Project DAVE' and our team eventually went on to win two awards for ‘Most Enterprising Business’ and the ‘Innovation Award’.</p>
            <p>As I entered into higher eductaion at college, I was given more opportunities to explore and improve my intrests. During college I had two projects where I able to push my knowledge by creating a desktop game using XNA while creating a website to advertise.

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This was a big stepping stone for me and the development of my game helped me further my knowledge in C#. While my website helped me learn to understand CSS and introduced to PHP where I connected the website to a database using SQL.</p>
            <p>As I continue through univeristy I being further pushed and developing my skills. This is being practiced in the creation of a Monopoly Board game as a Windows Form application in C# for 'Component Programming'. This website is also being developed for my 'Professional Experiance' module. </p>
            <p>Here is a link where you can download and view my Curriculum Vitae and a report for on of my Univeristy modules.<br></p>
