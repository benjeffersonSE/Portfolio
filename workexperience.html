            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <h2>Capgemini</h2>
            <p>During Year 10 I was also very lucky to be selected from a number of students to complete 2 weeks work experience at Capgemini in Telford.</p>
            <p>Whilst there I was given an insight on how a large organisation uses I.T. and what it is like working in an office environment.</p>
            <p>This included shadowing IT technicians and understanding how they used Oracle SQL databases for HMRC taxes.</p>
            <h2>Telford Wrekin Council</h2>
            <p>Completed 36 hours of work experiance at the Telford Wrekin Council</p>
            <p>Shadowed Web Developers and learned how they developed interactive websites for local schools</p>
            <p>This included languages such as HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and JavaScript/JQuery. This furher developed my skills working in a professional environment within an IT sector</p>
            <h2>Job Centre</h2>
            <p>An additional 36 hours of work experience at the Job Centre in Telford.</p>
            <p>Helped less technically experienced users apply for universal credit from the government website.</p>
            <p>This taught me important skills such as patients and communication while assisting users.</p>
            <h2>Primark</h2>
            <p>As an employee I was responsible for stocking, clearing and recovering the Home department.</p>
            <p>Being the only member of the department, this helped deal with task management and problem solving independently.</p>
            <p>Later I was moved to another department where I worked within a group of 3 to 4 members of staff. </p>
            <p>This further improved my communication and teamwork skills something which I found helpful and essential when working on tills and assisting customers.</p>
            <p>This has also improved my problem-solving skills and patience as often we will have an unhappy customer, or a customer with a problem such as an inquiry about stock. I use these skills to try and resolve a customer issue to the greatest outcome possible.</p>
            <p>Working at Primark introduced me into a professional environment and taught me a wide variety of vital skills such as teamwork, time management and customer service. These are incredibly important skills which are transferable and suited to a workplace.</p>
