            <p>Currently studying at Sheffield Hallam University, I am further pursuing my love for programming in Software Engineering. I have developed a wide range of programming skills covering C#, C++, JavaScript and PHP. </p>
            <p>I am passionate about programming and looking forward to pursuing further, enhancing my knowledge and developing new and interesting applications.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of Software Engineering I have many other additonal interests.</p> 
            <p>One of my biggest interests is my passion for music, which has been with me and developed over many years. </p>
            <p>This passion lead to me picking up and starting to learn guitar. As I progressed I decided to start a band where a few friends and I play songs togeather from my Faverouite bands such as: Green Day, Blink-182 and the Beatles to name a few. We have also now started to create our own orginal songs.</p>
            <p>I have also had an intrest in sports as I grewup playing football and running.</p>
            <p>I have recently joined the Sheffield Hallam Rowing team to further expand my experiance.</p>
            <p>Here below is a short video of my band and I.</p>
